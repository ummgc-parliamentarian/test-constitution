[2] A Member may be asked to re-audition for failing to meet the Music Director’s minimum expectations as outlined in the course syllabus.

[3] Both the Executive Board and the Music Director shall consult with one another before revoking a Member’s good standing or mandating that he re-audition.

**ARTICLE III. OPERATIONS**

**_Section 1. Business Meetings_**

[1] Business meetings shall be held following all regularly scheduled rehearsals, or at the discretion of the Executive Committee.

[2] A quorum for Business Meetings shall be two-thirds (2/3) of the total membership. A quorum must be established for a vote to be binding.

[3] A simple majority of the votes cast at a Business Meeting is binding. The Music Director, Assistant Music Director, Accompanist, and Advisor are non-voting members of the Glee Club.

**_Section 2. Annual Meeting_**

[1] The President, Vice-President and Parliamentarian shall be elected at the Annual Meeting of the Glee Club.

[2] The Executive Committee shall set the time and place of the Annual Meeting and provide reasonable notice of at least two (2) weeks prior to the Annual Meeting. If the Executive Committee judges that it is necessary to hold the Annual Meeting earlier than forty-five (45) days prior to the commencement of Winter Term examination period, it shall propose such a date and time at a regular Business Meeting, along with an explanation of why it believes an earlier date is necessary. The proposed date shall only be confirmed if it is approved by three-fourths (3/4) of the total voting membership in attendance at the Business Meeting. The Annual Meeting can be a regular Business Meeting.

[4] The Annual Meeting shall be conducted in accordance with the Standing Rules of the Glee Club.

**_Section 3. Tour Group_**

Ineligible members shall be added to the tour list, according to section needs, in order of points precedence only when the list of eligible members has been exhausted.

[4] Current members who either were not members or were inactive during the semester preceding the compilation of the tour list must earn seniority only for the term in which the tour list is compiled.

[5] The Music Director, Assistant Director, and the Accompanist are not bound by the point system. They may go on all tours.

[6] Prior to the selection of the tour group current members must be informed of the base cost of tour, and approximately the number of meals to be paid for out-of-pocket.

[7] In years where a tour subsidy is offered by the Glee Club, the Executive Committee shall determine the total amount of money available for subsidy and shall notify the Glee Club that subsidies are available. The award of subsidies to members shall be determined by the Music Director and the Faculty Advisor.

**_Section 4. Points_**

[1] One (1) point shall be awarded for each hour of work. Points in excess of this ratio shall be given only with approval from a member of the Executive Committee. Points may be awarded in increments of one-half (1/2).

[2] Twenty-five (25) seniority points, less points lost for violations of the attendance policy and for failure to sell the required amount of tickets for Hill Auditorium Concerts, shall be given to each active member each term, provided he fulfills the following requirements each term. The deadline to meet these requirements will be voted on by the executive committee and communicated to the rest of club 2 weeks prior to its deadline, or the last day of university classes:

i. Earns a minimum of five (5) points.

ii. Attends at least 3 small group sings per semester. Under ordinary circumstances, the Small Groups Managers are considered to fulfill this requirement in the normal execution of their duties.

[3] Points shall be awarded to members of the Executive Committee each semester, contingent on their achieving seniority, as follows:

President				100

Vice-President				75

Publicity Manager Emeritus		30 

DEI Chair Emeritus      			30

[4] The Executive Committee may delegate responsibilities to Junior Managers selected from the membership of the Glee Club. Points shall be awarded to Junior Managers each semester contingent upon their achieving seniority. A separate document shall enumerate titles, point values, and basic expectations for each position. The Executive Committee has the responsibility to finalize and publicize this document for the coming year by one (1) month before Junior Manager interviews. For exceptional cases, and according to need, the Executive Committee may add, merge, or remove positions for the coming year on the date of Junior Manager interviews after interviews have been conducted but before selections have been announced.

[5] The Executive Committee may delegate the authority to award points.

[6] Points for ticket sales shall be awarded as follows:

i. Members are required to sell fifteen (15) tickets for each Hill Auditorium Concert.

ii. If a member sells fewer than fifteen (15) tickets, a member shall lose one (1) point for each five (5) tickets, or fraction thereof, not sold.

iii. A member shall receive one half point for every ticket sold beyond the required fifteen.

iv. Points awarded for ticket sales shall not exceed the number awarded for seniority, and shall not count toward nor subtract from the number required to gain seniority.

[7] The Executive Committee may award negative points upon giving at least one (1) week’s notice to Glee Club of condition(s) under which the negative points shall be awarded. The Executive Committee itself must approve and specify the quantity of negative points which shall be awarded, and under which conditions they shall be awarded. The Executive Committee may not delegate the authority to award negative points except according to these predefined limits.

**_Section 5. Attendance and Loss of Points Resulting From Unexcused Absences_**

[1] Attendance is required at all Performances, Rehearsals, Business Meetings, and the Annual Meeting.

[2] Extraordinary circumstances that merit an excused absence shall be determined by the Executive Committee, who may delegate responsibility for such determination to a specific member(s) of the Committee. An excused absence from a rehearsal shall count as an excused absence from the corresponding Business Meeting.

[3] More than five (5) unexcused absences per year or more than three (3) unexcused absences per term shall place a Member’s good standing under review.  Said Member shall have the opportunity to discuss the matter with the Executive Committee.  A final decision shall be rendered by the student members of the Executive Committee.

[4] Absence from a Business Meeting shall be deemed a lateness.

[5] Every third lateness and every lateness of greater than one-half (1/2) hour shall be termed an unexcused absence, and shall be treated in the same manner as an unexcused absence received under Article III, Section 5[6]. Latenesses shall not be considered fractions of unexcused absences.

[6] Any unexcused absence from a Performance, Rehearsal, Business Meeting or the Annual Meeting shall result in the loss of one (1) point from the twenty-five (25) seniority points that can be earned in a term.

[7] Grounds for excusal from a Rehearsal shall include, but not be limited to:

i. Death in the family

ii. Serious mental or physical illness

iii. An exam that cannot be rescheduled

iv. Observance of a religious holiday

As the professional environment becomes more competitive it is understood that “professional development” activities have become more important in order to separate oneself from the crowd. Though we still expect a substantial commitment to Glee Club, if said activities further one's studies and scholarly goals, and potential missed rehearsal dates are given with as much possible notice, the executive committee will consider making said missed rehearsals “excused” absences. These excused absences may be contingent on certain commitments of the clubber in question, such as proof of proficiency of the semester’s music for the conductor or other requirements of clubbers to achieve seniority.

As both mental and physical illnesses can manifest suddenly and confirmation of their existence by a note from a doctor, therapist, or psychologist can add an increased burden, the executive committee will assume that absences for sudden illness are requested in good faith.

**_Section 6. Member Conduct_**

[1] Members of the Glee Club shall be bound by any and all policies adopted by the

Glee Club, including but not limited to the Glee Club’s Standing Rules.

[2] The Executive Committee shall have the ability to create and enforce sanctions for violations of Glee Club policies.
